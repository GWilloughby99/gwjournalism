          <h1>George Willoughby</h1>
          <h2>Data Journalist</h2>

          <p>As a data journalist, I look to find stories in numbers. This can be done through data visualisation and analysis. But, in my opinion, one of the most rewarding elements of the profession is revealing the human behind the numbers.</p>
          <p>Whilst producing this, I am learning CSS for the first time, as well as starting with HTML just a week before. My current projects include highlighting the impact Covid-19 has had on people living with Multiple Sclerosis, as well as an upcoming major project delving deeper into early years education in England.</p>
